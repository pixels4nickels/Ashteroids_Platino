This is a simple asteroids game using the Platino Game SDK (https://github.com/Lanica/Platform). 
I modified brejep's Ash entity system for JS (https://github.com/brejep/ash-js) to work with Platino.

The game is currently in progress. Right now all you can do is fly around and shoot, but that is pretty fun!
Here is a short list of what will be added soon:

- Managing lives
- Ship and Bullet Collisions
- Ship and Asteroid destroy states
- Refined UI controls
- Entity and System tuning (gameplay)
